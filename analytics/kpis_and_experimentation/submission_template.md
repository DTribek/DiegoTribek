# Analytics Track KPIs and Experimentation Homework

## User Story

Product: [DrogaRaia app]

I've been using this app for four years. You can buy everything from the drugstore for a better price.
Since I have diabetes, I need to buy the same medicatin every month.`


### Experiment 1

Changes: Get auto buy option for medication every number of days on regular basis (weekly, monthly)

Hypothesis: 
Increase in revenues, coming from clients that buy the same medication in a regular basis.
People would buy only from this app, if it was easier to set up instead of remembering to enter.

Test cell allocation:

- Control (no feature) - [50%]
- [Auto-buy option available] - [50%]

Leading Metrics:

- How many users turn auto-buy feature on
- App interaction.

Lagging Metrics:

- How much average revenue increased/decreased considering the two groups.
- How many users bought other products in the app that were not in auto-buy option ?


### Experiment 2

Changes: Small discount for products that you usually buy or Big discounts if you buy more.
(You buy medication for 2+ months in a single purchase)

Hypothesis: 

People that usually buy the same medication, would prefer to make a single
purchase, if they have any advantage (price in this case), instead of making multiple
purchases.

Besides that, multiple purchases allow users to buy in other place, since the price is 
similar or competitors can make promotions and take that purchase from you.

Test cell allocation:

- Control (no feature) - [40%]
- Bulk purchase - [30%]
- Small discount - [30%]


Leading Metrics:

- How many products are being sold with small and bulk discount ?
- How many products users are buying on a purchase ?  

Lagging Metrics:

- How much average revenue increased/decreased considering the three groups.
- How much products did the company sold compared to previous cycles ?


### Experiment 3

Changes: Make signature plans (VIP CLIENT), which gives some discount on delivery or medication

Hypothesis: If you buy medicine or pharmacy stuff all the time, you don't like to pay a fee to
get your medication delivered to you.  
Besides that, if you are going to spend some cash in medications,
would be good for the client to get discounts if they are part of a group/community, like
amazon prime.


Test cell allocation:

- Control (No option available) - [50%]
- VIP_1 (Pay to get the vip benefins) - [30%]
- VIP_2 (Get the VIP benefits for 1-2 months for free) - [20%]

Leading Metrics:

- How many vip clients do you have in each group ?
- How many purchases VIP clients are doing ?
- How much revenue is comming from signature ?

Lagging Metrics:

- Whats the average revenue and profit compared to previous cycles ?
- How many diffent clients are making purchases in the last 30/60/90 days ?
- Whats the conversion rate between VIP_2 (doesn't pay) to VIP_1 (pay to get the benefits)
- Considering clients purchases (usd), how are they segmented by group? Do VIP_1 / VIP_2 groups buy more than control group ?
